# React-native-Redux-Axios-server-interface
This ia a React-native-redux-axios-Template which uses axios for http request. It also uses redux for state management. In this
template the app has two tabs one for get request and on for post request. In the get request tab the app requests the server 
for data and displace it as a list in ScrollView. On selecting one of the items from the list we can move to a details page in 
the stack which shows the details of the page. In the post tab we have an text input and a button which enables us to send a 
post request to the server. ActivityIndicator component is used here.
